Refresh development rules and patterns from project documentation.

## Critical Rules Reminder

**NEVER proceed with code changes without explicit user approval**
**NEVER make assumptions about what user wants** 
**ALWAYS ask for confirmation before modifying code**

## Process

1. Read and internalize all rules from @symlink-config-rules.md
2. Review current architectural patterns and boundaries
3. Confirm understanding of user interaction requirements
4. Acknowledge any recent rule violations and commit to compliance

## Response Format

Confirm you have refreshed the rules and are ready to continue development with proper user interaction protocols.

## Usage

Use this prompt:
- At start of every new chat session
- Before major development tasks
- Every 2-3 hours during active development  
- Immediately after any rule violation
- When working on sensitive architectural areas
