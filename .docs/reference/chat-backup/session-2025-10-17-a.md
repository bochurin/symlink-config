# Chat Session - October 17, 2025

## Session Summary

**Focus**: Manager factory pattern, state/queue reorganization, workspace configuration

**Key Topics**:
- Fixed manager factory create-manager.ts (await on read, makeCallback signature)
- Removed managers Map from state (managers are stateless)
- Added custom Watcher types (FileWatcher, SettingsWatcher) in hook modules
- Changed getManager/getWatcher to getManagers/getWatchers accepting multiple names
- Moved state from extension/state/ to src/state/ with modular structure
- Moved queue from extension/queue.ts to src/queue/
- Created multiroot workspace configuration

## Detailed Conversation

### Manager Factory Issues

**Problem**: TypeScript errors in create-manager.ts
- Line 32: Missing `await` on `read()` call
- Line 33: `makeCallback` returning `void` instead of content type

**Solution**: 
- Added `await` to `const initialContent = await read()`
- Changed `makeCallback` to return `initialContent` instead of empty object

### State Module Enhancement

**Custom Watcher Types**:
- Added `FileWatcher = vscode.FileSystemWatcher` in use-file-watcher
- Added `SettingsWatcher = vscode.Disposable` in use-settings-watcher
- Created `Watcher = FileWatcher | SettingsWatcher` union in state/types
- Exported types from hook index files

**Enhanced Getters**:
```typescript
// Before: Single item
getManager(name: string): Manager | undefined
getWatcher(name: string): Watcher | undefined

// After: Multiple items, filtered array
getManagers(...names: string[]): Manager[]
getWatchers(...names: string[]): Watcher[]
```

**Removed Unused State**:
- Removed `nextSymlinkConfig` state (not used anywhere)

### State/Queue Reorganization

**Moved to src/ Level**:
- `extension/state/` ‚Üí `src/state/`
- `extension/queue.ts` ‚Üí `src/queue/`

**State Module Decomposition**:
```
src/state/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types.ts          # Watcher union type
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ workspace.ts      # Workspace root and name
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.ts             # Silent mode, tree provider, output channel
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ managers.ts       # Manager registry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ watchers.ts       # Watcher registry
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Public exports
```

**Queue Module Structure**:
```
src/queue/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ queue.ts          # Queue implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts          # Public exports
```

**Import Updates**: Updated 31 files across all modules

**ESLint Rules**: Added module boundary enforcement for state/ and queue/

### Multiroot Workspace

**Created**: `symlink-config.code-workspace`

**Folder Hierarchy** (by call stack order):
1. üìÅ Project Root
2. üìö Documentation
3. 1Ô∏è‚É£ Entry Point (main.ts)
4. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extension Lifecycle
5. 3Ô∏è‚É£ State Management
6. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Queue
7. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Watchers
8. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Managers
9. 6Ô∏è‚É£ Commands
10. 7Ô∏è‚É£ Views
11. üîß Shared Utilities

**Settings**: Moved from .vscode/settings.json to workspace settings

### Context Prompt Creation

**Problem**: New chat sessions after opening workspace file lose project context

**Solution**: Created reusable context-gathering prompt

**Prompt Structure**:
```
I'm continuing development on the Symlink Config VSCode extension. Please review the project documentation to understand the current state:

@.docs/project/migration-from-cvhere.md - Project overview and goals
@.docs/development/progress-log.md - Current phase and implementation status
@.docs/reference/source-code-map.md - Complete codebase reference
@.docs/development/decisions/decisions.md - All architectural decisions
@.docs/.amazonq/rules/symlink-config-rules.md - Development rules and patterns

Key context:
- Current version: 0.0.62
- Phase: 1.43 Complete (State/Queue Module Reorganization)
- Architecture: Modular state at src/ level, shared module isolation enforced
- Recent changes: Multiroot workspace, state decomposition, custom watcher types

Please confirm you've reviewed the documentation and are ready to continue development.
```

**Benefits**:
- Loads all essential documentation files
- Provides current version and phase
- Highlights recent architectural changes
- Ensures seamless continuation across chat sessions

**Storage**: Saved in `~/.aws/amazonq/prompts/Context.md` for easy access

## Technical Discussions

### Async/Await Behavior

**Question**: Can sync function call async one?
**Answer**: Yes, but can't await the result - "fire and forget" behavior

**Question**: Can async function call sync one?
**Answer**: Yes, works perfectly - sync executes immediately

**Question**: Can sync function be awaited?
**Answer**: Yes, JavaScript wraps return value in resolved Promise automatically

### Shared Module Isolation

**Rule**: No module in shared/ should import from outside its folder

**Solution**: Pass `workspaceRoot` as parameter instead of importing from state
- Updated all file-ops functions to accept `workspaceRoot` parameter
- Updated all callers to pass `workspaceRoot`

### State Architecture Decisions

**Managers Map**: Removed from state because managers are stateless function collections
- No caching needed - read from disk each time
- If caching needed in future, cache in state, not in managers

**Watchers Self-Registration**: User decided watchers should self-register
- Watchers are application-level modules
- Can know about state
- No need to return disposables

## Commits

## Key Insights

**Architecture Principles**:
- State and queue are application-level, not extension-specific
- Shared modules must be self-contained (no imports from application)
- Managers are stateless - no need to store in registry
- Watchers self-register for cleaner architecture

**Type System**:
- Custom types defined where they're created (hook modules)
- Union types for storage (state module)
- Generic types with proper constraints (Manager<CT, ET>)

**Module Organization**:
- Core modules at src/ level (state, queue, shared, managers, etc.)
- Extension folder only for lifecycle code
- Modular structure for complex modules (state decomposed into 5 files)
