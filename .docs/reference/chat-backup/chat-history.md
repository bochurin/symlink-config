# Chat History - Symlink Config Extension Development

## Session 1: Project Setup and CVHere Migration (02.10.2025)

### Context
- User wanted to continue from Phase 1.2 Context Migration
- Extension project already created with VSCode integration setup
- Goal: Implement core symlink functionality with JSON parsing and workspace detection

### Key Discussions

#### Initial Assessment
- Examined existing project structure with basic TypeScript implementation
- Found bash scripts from CVHere project in `src/scripts/symlink/`
- Identified need for proper TypeScript translation vs bash wrapper approach

#### Implementation Approach Decision
- User decided against polishing bash scripts, preferred direct TypeScript migration
- CVHere project chat provided complete TypeScript translation
- Found translated modules in `src/symlink/` directory

#### CVHere TypeScript Integration
- Discovered complete implementation already existed:
  - `types.ts` - Interfaces matching CVHere system
  - `utils.ts` - Path resolution, Windows detection, @-syntax support
  - `gitignore.ts` - SymLinks block management
  - `creator.ts` - Cross-platform symlink creation with Windows batch support
  - `manager.ts` - Main processing logic from process-path.sh
- Updated extension.ts to use new CVHere-based manager
- Successfully compiled and tested core functionality

#### Documentation Organization
- User questioned why IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md was in root instead of .docs
- Discovered proper CVHere documentation structure in .docs folder
- Moved IMPLEMENTATION-STATUS.md to `.docs/development/implementation-status.md`
- Updated README.md references to match proper structure

#### GitHub Repository Setup
- Initialized git repository
- Created GitHub repository: https://github.com/bochurin/symlink-config
- Successfully pushed complete CVHere TypeScript implementation
- Project ready for community contributions and VSCode Marketplace

#### CVHere Utilities Integration
- User requested CVHere utility scripts (commit management, Q menu, init-jq)
- Copied commit scripts from `../cvhere/scripts/utils/commit/`
- Added Amazon Q prompts menu system from `../cvhere/scripts/utils/q/`
- Integrated init-jq.sh for cross-platform JSON parsing
- Enhanced package.json with structured commit workflow scripts

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ Complete CVHere logic translation to TypeScript
- ✅ Cross-platform symlink creation (Windows batch files, Unix ln -s)
- ✅ Distributed .gitignore tracking with SymLinks blocks
- ✅ @-syntax path resolution for project root relative paths
- ✅ VSCode integration with Command Palette and status bar
- ✅ Proper documentation structure following CVHere approach
- ✅ GitHub repository published and ready for development
- ✅ CVHere development utilities integrated (commit scripts, Q menu, JSON tools)

### Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete** - TypeScript Implementation & Development Tools Setup
- All CVHere symlink management logic preserved in TypeScript
- VSCode extension fully functional with commands and UI
- Documentation properly organized
- Development utilities from CVHere integrated
- Repository published and ready for next development phase

### Next Steps
- Phase 2: Testing and refinement
- VSCode Marketplace preparation
- Community feedback integration

## Session 2: Development Utilities Integration (02.10.2025)

### Context
- User requested integration of CVHere development utilities
- Focus on commit management scripts and Amazon Q integration
- Goal: Add structured development workflow tools from CVHere project

### Key Activities

#### Utility Scripts Integration
- Copied `code-commit.sh` and `docs-commit.sh` from CVHere project
- Added Amazon Q prompts menu system (`prompts-menu.sh`)
- Integrated `init-jq.sh` for cross-platform JSON parsing support
- Created proper directory structure: `scripts/utils/commit/` and `scripts/utils/q/`

#### Package.json Enhancement
- Added commit workflow scripts:
  - `git:code:commit` - Interactive code commits
  - `git:code:commit:auto` - Auto-commit with message file
  - `git:docs:commit` - Interactive documentation commits
  - `git:docs:commit:auto` - Auto-commit docs with message file
- Added Amazon Q integration:
  - `q:menu` - Interactive prompts menu with navigation
  - `q:prompts` - Direct access to prompts directory

#### Workflow Testing
- Successfully tested auto-commit functionality
- Verified structured commit separation (code vs docs)
- Confirmed Amazon Q prompts integration works

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ CVHere commit workflow scripts integrated
- ✅ Amazon Q prompts menu system functional
- ✅ Cross-platform JSON parsing utility added
- ✅ Package.json enhanced with development scripts
- ✅ Structured commit workflow established

### Current Status
**Development Tools Complete** - All CVHere utilities integrated
- Structured commit workflow operational
- Amazon Q integration functional
- JSON processing utilities available
- Ready for enhanced development workflow
