## Session 3: File Watcher System and Architecture Refactoring (02.10.2025)

### Context
- User needed help testing symlink-config VSCode extension
- Extension had issues with loading and infinite loops in file watchers
- Goal: Implement robust file watching system and fix architectural issues

### Key Technical Challenges

#### Extension Loading Issues
- Initial problem: Extension not loading properly in VSCode
- Root cause: Class-based architecture was complex and had initialization issues
- Solution: Converted to functional approach for better maintainability and composability

#### File Watcher System Implementation
- **Requirement**: Watch for changes in symlink.config.json files, next.symlink.config.json, .gitignore, and .git repository
- **Implementation**: Created comprehensive file watcher orchestrator using VSCode FileSystemWatcher API
- **Components**:
  - `file-watcher-orchestrator.ts` (later renamed to `watcher-orchestrator.ts`, then `set-watchers.ts`)
  - `file-watcher-hook.ts` (later renamed to `watcher-hook.ts`, then `hooks/use-file-watcher.ts`)
  - `next-config-manager.ts` - Manages next.symlink.config.json generation
  - `gitignore-manager.ts` - Manages gitignore sections with Begin/End markers

#### Infinite Loop Bug Discovery and Fix
- **Problem**: GitignoreManager writing to .gitignore triggered its own watcher, creating infinite loop
- **Root Cause**: Watcher detecting its own file changes and triggering updates repeatedly
- **Solution**: Implemented state tracking pattern with `lastWrittenContent` variable
- **Additional Fix**: Converted section management from line-by-line parsing to regex-based approach

#### Architecture Refactoring
- **From**: Class-based architecture with factory functions (`createFileWatcherOrchestrator`, `createGitignoreManager`)
- **To**: Functional architecture with direct exports and simple init methods
- **Benefits**: Cleaner code, better composability, easier maintenance
- **File Structure**: Organized into `managers/`, `hooks/`, and `types/` directories

#### Project Reorganization
- User reorganized project structure during development:
  - `src/managers/gitignore/` - Gitignore management with index.ts export
  - `src/managers/next-config/` - Next config management with index.ts export  
  - `src/hooks/` - Reusable hooks like file watcher utility
  - `src/types/` - Type definitions
  - `src/set-watchers.ts` - Main watcher orchestrator
  - `src/extension.ts` - Simplified extension entry point

#### Code Simplification
- **Removed**: All VSCode commands and status bar (not implemented yet)
- **Simplified**: Extension to only run file watchers automatically
- **Shortened**: File names from `file-watcher-*` to `watcher-*` for cleaner naming
- **Eliminated**: Unnecessary `create*` wrapper functions

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ **File Watcher System**: Comprehensive watching of all relevant files
- ✅ **Infinite Loop Fix**: State tracking prevents watcher feedback loops
- ✅ **Functional Architecture**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
- ✅ **Project Organization**: Logical directory structure with proper exports
- ✅ **Code Simplification**: Removed unnecessary complexity and wrapper functions
- ✅ **Regex-based Processing**: More robust gitignore section management

### Current Status
**Phase 1.7 Complete** - File Watcher System and Architecture Refactoring
- Robust file watching system operational
- Infinite loop issues resolved with state tracking
- Clean functional architecture implemented
- Project properly organized with logical structure
- Extension simplified to core functionality only
- Ready for command implementation and testing phase

## Session 4: Code Organization and Architecture Refinement (02.10.2025)

### Context
- User wanted to improve code organization and simplify architecture
- Focus on implementing "one file = one function" pattern
- Goal: Clean up codebase with better separation of concerns

### Key Refactoring Activities

#### Global State Management
- **Problem**: Workspace root and state scattered across modules
- **Solution**: Centralized all state in `src/state.ts`
- **Added**: `gitignoreIsUpdating`, `gitignoreSectionEntries` to global state
- **Benefits**: Single source of truth, easier debugging, consistent state access

#### Gitignore Manager Decomposition
- **Applied**: One file = one function pattern
- **Structure Created**:
  ```
  gitignore/
  ├── constants.ts
  ├── memo.ts (memo function)
  ├── make.ts (make function)
  ├── file-ops/
  │   ├── get-gitignore-path.ts
  │   ├── read-gitignore.ts
  │   ├── write-gitignore.ts
  │   └── ensure-gitignore-exists.ts
  ├── section/
  │   ├── create-section.ts
  │   ├── remove-section.ts
  │   ├── get-current-section-entries.ts
  │   └── is-section-valid.ts
  └── operations/
      ├── ensure-section-exists.ts
      ├── add-entry-to-section.ts
      ├── remove-entry-from-section.ts
      └── remove-symlink-entries.ts
  ```

#### Next-Config Manager Decomposition
- **Applied**: Same one file = one function pattern
- **Structure Created**:
  ```
  next-config/
  ├── memo.ts (memo function)
  ├── make.ts (make function)
  ├── handle-manual-change.ts
  └── handle-manual-delete.ts
  ```

#### Function Naming Improvements
- **Renamed Functions**:
  - `init()` → `memo()` (memoization/initialization)
  - `updateBasedOnConfiguration()` → `make()` (creates/builds gitignore)
  - `generateNextConfig()` → `make()` (creates next config)
  - `handleNextConfigChange()` → `handleManualChange()`
  - `handleNextConfigDelete()` → `handleManualDelete()`

#### Architecture Simplification
- **Removed**: Unnecessary `create*` wrapper functions
- **Converted**: From object-based exports to direct function exports
- **Eliminated**: Redundant orchestrator files
- **Simplified**: Index.ts files to clean re-exports only

#### Development Tools Integration
- **Added**: Prettier for code formatting
- **Added**: ESLint import organization plugin
- **Configured**: Format on save and import sorting
- **Enhanced**: Package.json with formatting scripts

### Technical Achievements
- ✅ **One File = One Function**: Complete decomposition achieved
- ✅ **Global State Management**: Centralized state in state.ts
- ✅ **Clean Architecture**: Functional approach with direct exports
- ✅ **Better Naming**: Descriptive function names (memo, make, handle*)
- ✅ **Code Organization**: Logical grouping in subfolders
- ✅ **Development Tools**: Prettier and ESLint integration
- ✅ **Consistent Patterns**: Same structure across all managers

### Final Improvements
- **Unified Manual Handling**: Combined `handleManualChange` and `handleManualDelete` into single `handleManualAction(action: 'change' | 'delete')` function
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Added try-catch blocks for file operations
- **Better State Integration**: Updated to use centralized state management
- **Improved User Feedback**: Dynamic messages based on action type

### Current Status
**Architecture Complete** - Clean, maintainable codebase
- One file = one function pattern implemented throughout
- Global state management operational
- Functional architecture with direct exports
- Enhanced development tools integrated
- Ready for comprehensive testing and feature development

### Next Steps
- Implement VSCode commands (Create All, Clean All, Dry Run)
- Add comprehensive testing
- User experience refinement
- VSCode Marketplace preparation
