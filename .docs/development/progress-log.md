# Symlink Config Extension - Development Progress

## Project Overview

**Goal**: VSCode extension for automated symlink management across project containers and workspaces  
**Approach**: Translate proven CVHere symlink system to TypeScript with VSCode integration  
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 Complete - TypeScript Implementation with Test Suite

## Development Phases

### ✅ Phase 1.60: Package.json Simplification (Completed - 26.10.2025)

- **Date**: 26.10.2025
- **Status**: Complete
- **Details**:
  - **Removed Build System**: Eliminated JavaScript build script and package_json decomposition
  - **Unified Structure**: Restored single package.json file for simplicity
  - **Maintained Functionality**: All 81 tests pass, successful webpack build
  - **Clean Architecture**: Direct package.json editing without build complexity
  - **Simplified Maintenance**: No build step required for package.json changes

### Previous Phases (Completed)

## Current Status

**Phase**: Phase 1.60 Complete - Package.json Simplification  
**Branch**: `main`  
**Version**: 0.0.87  
**Latest**: Simplified package.json structure without build system complexity  
**Extension Status**: Core development complete with robust architecture, zero violations, comprehensive test coverage, and simplified configuration  
**Next**: Cross-platform testing and validation (Phase 2)
